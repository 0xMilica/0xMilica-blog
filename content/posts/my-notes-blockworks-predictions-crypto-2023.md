## Cryptoâ€™s 2022 wrapped
Compared to prior cycles, we started to see real use cases.<br/><br/>
ATM, there is a global financial crisis in the blockchain mostly due to translating TradFi into DeFi, and the lack of transparency.<br/><br/>
This is the first [bear market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp) in history where people have not thought that the industry is done.<br/><br/>
The positivity of technology has been acknowledged. The flight of talent into the industry is here to stay.<br/><br/>
1st QRT is gonna be a wipeout due to seasonality, poor vortexes, and global growth slowing.

## The bottom is in for crypto, not for equities
Crypto is moving off of the back of the interest rates.<br/><br/>

_Figure 1: Correlation between crypto and S&P500 and NASDAQ_

BTC looks like a pretty similar chart compared to [SP500](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp) and [NASDAQ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp).<br/><br/>
Crypto front runs expectations around liquidity a couple of months beforehand, which is driven by interest rates.<br/><br/>
Dynamic correlation is broken post-May in crypto due to:<br/><br/>
Crypto is being driven by fundamental dynamics in our space more than liquidity.<br/><br/>
Macro holders base of crypto which was enforcing this relationship between liquidity and interest rates in crypto largely exited the space.<br/><br/>
Now: retail kind of holder base in crypto.<br/><br/>

_Figure 2: Coinmetrics MVRV - Market Value vs Realised Value_

**High MVRV** - an indication that speculators are in control, probably marking a top.<br/>
**Low MVRV** - holders controlling the market, probably marking the bottom.<br/><br/>
ATM - historically low [MVRV](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/mvrv). The last time MVRV bottomed was late 2018/early 2019. BTC was only up from that point till the next bull market <br/><br/>

The worst is basically in for crypto.<br/><br/>
Crypto winter ended in June, weâ€™re in spring till April next year and then we get to the crypto summer. The angle of crypto summer is correlated with the ability of the masses to have adoption.

## The kings of Spot & NFT trading will lose market share
1st prediction: **Uniswap** passes **Coinbase** in volume in 2023 - driven by Uniswapâ€™s push into **NFTs**.

2nd prediction: self-custody wallets. DeFi summer: 15-16% was the high, today: 8-10%, 2023: 25%

3rd prediction: **OpenSea** ends up falling in market share. Uniswap is launching NFTs. **Pseudoswap** for AMM style floor-trading NFTs. Multiple kinds of NFTs will set their own exchanges (e.g. music, fashion) and therefore steal market share from OpenSea.

## Stablecoins, DeFiâ€™s resurgence and Permissioned Protocols
The reason why stablecoin did not grow up to a trillion:
- recursive [leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp) dried up
- TerraUSD (UST) wiped out 20 billion
- Stablecoins will continue to be the primary driver for growth in the industry and usability. Next year will be largely guided by regulation.

## Regulators are coming, and the CBDC debate
Regulators are going to fight 2022-2027.<br/><br/>
Transition to web3 is going to happen. [CBDC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc.asp) is not positive.<br/><br/>
CBDC is going to happen and that is good for adoption.

## MEV will be the business model for DeFi and Exchanges
[MEV](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/mev/) is going to be the dominant business model for DeFi and thatâ€™s going to lead to exchanges vertically integrate and extracting profits from MEV.<br/><br/>
Uniswap is going to do to monetise by arranging orders of transaction through validators.<br/><br/>
**App chains** end up winning. The logical step for Coinbase of Kraken is to launch its chain.<br/><br/>
Transitioning to private chains and private transactions in 2023.

## No industry takes off without insurance
Insurance should be off-chain due to the correlation risk. ATM DeFi yields are lower than treasuries. DeFi yields should be higher than each staking yield.<br/><br/>
Crypto winter canâ€™t end until **DOGE** and **SHIB** are zero.

## ETH vs BTC
**BTC replaces gold** as the base layer of money.

## Miner capitulation, wallet wars and gaming
BTC miners are not only theyâ€™re liquidating their entire supply of newly mined coins, but now they have to dip into their own BTC reserves.<br/><br/>
Next war - **wallet wars** (Phantom, Argent, Brave).<br/><br/>
A big trend - the beginning of the end of hot wallets.<br/><br/>
The next cycle will be gaming. â…” startups are going to die. Coinbase gets acquired.<br/><br/>
Itâ€™s bottom for miners already.

## Vertical integrations, privacy and payments
dYdX departing from ETH and trying to build their own.<br/><br/>
Every brand is going to launch a digital collectable - the next era of the NFT space.<br/><br/>
NFT will become a way to own everything.

## The rise of professional guilds
The rise of professional guilds of skilled labour that organise themselves into distinct sections. What weâ€™ll ultimately be going to see is either DAOs or these big associations of people who do this sort of thing.
